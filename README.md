## Project Goal

Chords are hard. Changing chords is harder. Changing from a `Dm7b5` to a `G13` and then to `Cm9` at lighting fast speed without making any mistakes is nearly impossible.

Introducing chordinate™.

With chordinate™, you can practice any chords you choose in any order you like at any speed you desire whenever you feel like it (and have your instrument with you).

Become a better person today. Use chordinate™.
